Claude Code Web Manager for Debian
===================================

This package provides a web-based interface for managing Claude Code CLI projects
on Raspberry Pi and other ARM64/x64 Linux systems.

System User
-----------

The application runs as the 'distiller' system user, which is automatically created
during installation with the following permissions:

- Primary group: distiller
- Additional groups: sudo, gpio, dialout, i2c, spi, audio, video
- Home directory: /opt
- Shell: /bin/bash

This user has comprehensive hardware access permissions suitable for Raspberry Pi
development and GPIO operations.

Installation Directories
------------------------

- Application: /opt/claude-code-web-manager/
- Configuration: /etc/claude-code-web-manager/
- Logs: /var/log/claude-code-web-manager/
- Data: /var/lib/claude-code-web-manager/
- Projects: /opt/claude-code-web-manager/projects/

Service Management
------------------

The application is managed by systemd:

  sudo systemctl start claude-code-web-manager
  sudo systemctl stop claude-code-web-manager
  sudo systemctl restart claude-code-web-manager
  sudo systemctl status claude-code-web-manager

Web Interface
-------------

After installation and service start, the web interface is available at:

- http://localhost:3000
- http://YOUR_RASPBERRY_PI_IP:3000

Default Configuration
---------------------

The default configuration can be found in:
/etc/claude-code-web-manager/default.json

Key settings:
- Server port: 3000
- TTYd port: 7681
- Projects directory: /opt/claude-code-web-manager/projects

Hardware Features
-----------------

This package includes support for Raspberry Pi hardware features:

- GPIO access through raspi-gpio and direct /dev/gpiomem
- I2C device access through /dev/i2c-* devices
- SPI device access through /dev/spidev* devices
- Serial device access through /dev/ttyUSB*, /dev/ttyACM*, /dev/ttyAMA*
- Audio and video device access

The distiller user has appropriate group memberships and sudo permissions
for hardware operations.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Check service status:
   sudo systemctl status claude-code-web-manager

2. View service logs:
   sudo journalctl -u claude-code-web-manager -f

3. Check if ports are available:
   sudo lsof -i :3000
   sudo lsof -i :7681

4. Verify user permissions:
   groups distiller

5. Test TTYd binary:
   sudo -u distiller /opt/claude-code-web-manager/ttyd.aarch64 --version

Security Notes
--------------

The distiller user has sudo privileges for specific system operations required
for hardware access and service management. The sudoers configuration is
restrictive and only allows necessary commands.

The systemd service runs with appropriate security restrictions while
maintaining hardware access capabilities.

For production deployments, consider:
- Configuring a firewall to limit access to ports 3000 and 7681
- Setting up HTTPS with a reverse proxy
- Configuring authentication if needed
